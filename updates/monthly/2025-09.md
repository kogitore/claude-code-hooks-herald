# Monthly — 2025-09

## Highlights
- Shipped MVP audio hooks for `Notification`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStop` with cross-platform playback (afplay, ffplay/aplay, winsound).
- Delivered configurable audio mapping via `.claude/hooks/utils/audio_config.json` with alias normalization.
- Implemented zero-dependency Windows volume control using in-memory `audioop` processing.
- Added smart throttling cache to avoid repeated playback spam across sessions.

## Decisions Made
- Accepted ADR-0001 Audio Mapping Strategy ([details](../../decisions/0001-audio-mapping.md)).
- Accepted ADR-0002 Audio Throttling Strategy ([details](../../decisions/0002-throttling-strategy.md)).

## Experiments Run
- Windows volume control spike confirmed feasibility of in-memory scaling ([notes](../../experiments/windows-volume-control.md)).

## Risks / Debts
- Log-based throttling cache (`logs/audio_throttle.json`) will grow over time; rotation policy pending.
- Only WAV assets are supported; need guidance for teams with MP3/OGG libraries.
- Limited automated coverage for multi-process audio playback on Windows.

## Plan for Next Month
- Evaluate bundling default sound assets with explicit licensing.
- Research PulseAudio/ALSA backends for broader Linux support.
- Explore layered audio cues (priority tiers) and optional formatting/test automation triggers.
