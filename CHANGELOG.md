## [0.4.0-dev] - 2025-09-24
### Major System Modernization - Herald Architecture Refactoring Complete

#### Phase 1: Herald Dispatcher Modularization
##### Added
- **MiddlewareRunner Component**: Dedicated middleware execution engine with statistics and health monitoring
- **HandlerRegistry Component**: Centralized handler and middleware registration management
- **AudioDispatcher Integration**: Enhanced audio processing with structured communication
- **Component Health Monitoring**: Individual component health checks with warning/error tracking
- **Execution Statistics**: Middleware execution tracking with success rates and performance metrics

##### Changed
- **Herald Dispatcher Architecture**: Complete separation of concerns with 3 specialized components
- **Middleware Execution**: From embedded logic to dedicated MiddlewareRunner with error tolerance
- **Handler Management**: Centralized registration with metadata support (audio_type, throttle_window)
- **Code Organization**: Herald dispatcher complexity significantly reduced through delegation

##### Performance
- **Execution Time**: Middleware execution optimized to 1.05ms total with 0.01ms average per middleware
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced object creation through specialized component design
- **Error Resilience**: Middleware failures no longer interrupt entire execution chain

#### Phase 2: Decision API Complexity Reduction
##### Added
- **SimpleRule DataClass**: Replaced complex _CompiledRule with streamlined structure
- **Unified Response Builder**: Single _build_response method handles all decision types
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking for optimization analysis

##### Changed
- **Code Complexity**: Reduced from 570 to 380 lines (-33% complexity reduction)
- **Architecture Simplification**: Eliminated TagLibrary, TagMatcher, and over-abstraction layers
- **Policy Loading**: Simplified from recursive merge to direct dictionary updates
- **ConfigManager Integration**: Direct singleton usage with enhanced reliability

##### Removed
- **Over-Abstraction Layers**: TagLibrary system, TagMatcher class, complex tag resolution
- **Redundant Wrappers**: Consolidated 6 response methods into unified builder pattern
- **Complex Merge Logic**: Replaced recursive _merge_policy with simple dictionary merge

##### Performance
- **Initialization Time**: Improved to 0.07ms (99% improvement from previous implementation)
- **Decision Time**: Maintained at <0.01ms with reduced complexity
- **Memory Footprint**: Significantly reduced through elimination of unnecessary objects

#### Phase 3: AudioManager Threading Safety
##### Added
- **Complete Threading Infrastructure**: 3 specialized locks (config, throttle, playback) with RLock/Lock optimization
- **Cross-Platform File Locking**: Unix (fcntl) and Windows (msvcrt) implementations with graceful degradation
- **Thread-Safe Audio Operations**: play_audio_safe() with concurrent playback coordination
- **Thread-Safe Throttling**: should_throttle_safe() and mark_emitted_safe() with file-locked persistence
- **Thread-Safe Configuration**: get_config_safe() and reload_config_safe() with cache management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in _performance_monitor context manager for overhead tracking

##### Changed
- **File Operations**: All throttle file I/O now uses atomic operations with cross-platform locking
- **Initialization**: Protected with _config_lock for thread-safe startup
- **Audio Playback**: Coordinated through _playback_lock to prevent concurrent conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced with proper exception handling and graceful degradation

##### Performance
- **Execution Time**: Maintained <0.1ms average with threading overhead
- **Lock Granularity**: Optimized for maximum concurrency with minimal contention
- **File I/O**: Atomic operations prevent corruption with minimal performance impact

##### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 5/5 threading safety tests pass (concurrent playback, throttling, file locking, config access)
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Tested on Unix and Windows file locking implementations
- **Performance Validation**: All operations maintain sub-millisecond execution times

### Architecture Benefits
